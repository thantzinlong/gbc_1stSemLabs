        tables are tabular data formed by rows & colums.
        We call these boxes of cells. 
        A table is made up of rows using a tr tag. 
        You have a single row and within the row you have data cells using td tag. 
        you get columns by adding rows of data cells within each rows. 
        colspan: spans columns.
        rowspan: spans rows. 
    
        vertical cell alignment: can be top, middle of bottom ( only for vertical alignment).
         cell horizontal alignment: can be left, center or right. 
         thead tag is for table header(optional, good to have)
         tr tags are within tbody tag (optional, good to have)
         tfoot tag if for table footer (optional, good to have)
         
         cell padding: refers to the cushion around cells.
         cell spacing: refers to the space between cells.
         cell width and height can be changed as well.
         When height is given to the cell, all cells in the row will adhere to that height.
